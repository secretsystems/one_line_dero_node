# one_line_dero_node

Basically the easiest way to launch a node is to have a script do it for you. And so, have your terminal echo all the commands you give it and append them into an file called `installnode.sh`. Then make that file executable and run it. 

But seeing as that's a lot of typing. Just curl the templates I already made into your terminal. Simple as...

# linux
