# one_line_dero_node

Basically the easiest way to launch a node is to have a script do it for you. 

For a [fastsync](GitHub.com/secretsystems/one_line_dero_node/blob/main/fastsync.sh) node, drop the command in your terminal and press enter.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secretsystems/one_line_dero_node/main/fastsync.sh)
```
